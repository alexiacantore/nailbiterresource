  <p>A design critique is fabricated to review a piece of work created to further the process of the design and develop feedback from others to better finalize the final product being conducted. In a critique, the designer brings all the materials they have developed thus far explaining how they conduct the design and how the final product will appear. A critique can be intimidating and sometimes difficult to understand as both the designer and as the other members. However, it is important to remember that when a body of work is being critiqued, no comments should be taken personally to the designer themselves and instead only be used in good honour to better the final product. A critique encourages a collaborative apprach to team building and understanding design as a whole. </p>
